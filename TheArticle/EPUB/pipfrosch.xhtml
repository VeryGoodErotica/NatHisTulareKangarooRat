  <h1 id="piph1">About Pipfrosch Press</h1>
  <p>Pipfrosch Press is named after the original species description for the Northern Leopard Frog <span class="taxon">Lithobates pipiens</span> by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber. A translation of that species description from the Fraktur script German to English is planned.</p>
  <p>Pipfrosch Press is a digital publication organization targeting citizen science but also is an <em>activity</em> organization targeting citizen science. It is my vision that guided hikes in urban trails readily accessibly by bus and that are paved for wheelchair access are provided for the benefit of the local communities, helping residents enjoy the beauty of the natural diversity around them in hopes that it help promote the preservation of this natural diversity to the greatest extent possible.</p>
  <p>Pipfrosch Press is not affiliated with <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/" title="Internet Resource">iNaturalist</a> on a structural organization level however a goal of Pipfrosch Press is to encourage the use of that citizen science database for the benefit of increased data to both scientific researchers and to wildlife conservation efforts.</p>
  <p>For digital content publications, Pipfrosch Press will publish content primarily in the ePub format without financial cost to the consumer of the content.</p>
  <p>ePub reader software is freely available for a variety of computing platforms and works very well on the smaller screen sizes of so-called &#8216;smart&#8217; devices and the ePub format allows for easy integration of content accessibility features, allowing the publications of Pipfrosch Press to be enjoyed by many who are not able to adequately use the print or <abbr>PDF</abbr> formats due to disabilities. All content will comply with <abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2.1 Level AA success criteria with Level AAA success criteria met where it is not cost prohibitive to do so.</p>
  <p>Part of what Pipfrosch Press will publish includes academic journal articles that are of benefit to citizen science.</p>
  <p>For the most part, Pipfrosch Press will focus on papers that are either part of the Public Domain or are published under a Creative Commons license that specifically allows redistribution without payment due. When an article that is not part of the public domain or published with a Creative Commons license is of particular value to citizen science, we may attempt to get the permission needed to publish it.</p>
  <p>Original species descriptions and high quality natural history articles are examples of the type of articles likely to be of practical benefit to citizen science. On the other hand, something like a cladistic analysis of the <span class="taxon">pseudacris regilla</span> cryptic species complex is fascinating but is not likely to have practical application to citizen science and is not of particular interest for Pipfrosch Press ePub republication.</p>
  <p>All Pipfrosch Press academic article content will be expected to properly render (with the exception of <abbr>MathML</abbr>) on the <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-hd" title="Internet Resource">Kobo Clara <abbr>HD</abbr></a> reader and should properly render in any ePub 3.2 compliant reading device. The Kobo Clara <abbr>HD</abbr> was chosen as the reference hardware reader because is readily available to those with a lower income. Using it as a reference device also gives a high probability that the publications will properly render in the free Kobo software reader for Android and Apple mobile devices. The ePub is also tested in other readers, such as the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyersoft.moonreaderp" title="Internet Resource">Moon+ Reader for Android</a> and the Apple Books reader for Apple devices. We also test with the <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/" title="Internet Resource">Calibre reader</a> available for desktop operating systems.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, Amazon Kindle uses a proprietary digital publication format and does not provide a tool that adequately converts ePub to their proprietary format. Specifically, the conversion tool they do provide chokes on accessibility markup and it would be cost prohibite to Pipfrosch Press to try to maintain an accessible version of our publications for standard compliant ePub viewers and a second version for Amazon Kindle conversion. Proprietary formats are the antithesis of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access" title="Internet Resource">Open Access</a> philosophy that Pipfrosch Press and even some academic journals now embrace.</p>

    <p><em>Times of activity on the surface of the ground</em>.&#8212;The kangaroo rat is essentially a nocturnal
mammal, so far as its activity above ground is concerned. Rarely has the writer
seen members of this genus voluntarily emerge from their burrows in the daytime.
On a clear day in early spring, he saw members of the species <span class="taxon">Dipodomys nitratoides</span>
leave their burrows as many as seven minutes before sunset.</p>
    <p>Better to describe this diurnal activity, the following field notes of the writer for
<time datetime="1938-02-23">February 23, 1938</time> are quoted: &#8220;This evening reset my can-traps, using the same bait
(rolled oats). It was close to sundown when I started putting out traps. While setting
them, I heard a trap snap about 150 yards behind me. I went back and found I had
caught a live adult <span class="taxon">Dipodomys nitratoides nitratoides</span>. The sun was about five minutes
from setting when the trap went off; I had set the trap not more than five minutes previously.
Continued putting out traps, and just as the sun was setting I caught another
of this species. By the time I had finished putting out all my twenty traps (about ten
minutes past sundown), I had caught a total of four rats.&#8221; This abnormal activity may
have resulted from damage to food stores by heavy rains of a few days previously.</p>
    <p><span class="taxon">Dipodomys heermanni tularensis</span> appears to be more strictly nocturnal than
<span class="taxon"><abbr>D.</abbr> nitratoides</span>.
Once, when the writer watched adjacent burrows of the two species, <span class="taxon">nitratoides</span>
emerged five to twelve minutes earlier; even then the earliest <span class="taxon">nitratoides</span> emerged six
minutes past sundown.</p>
    <p>Under normal conditions probably light intensity is the most important single factor
governing the time of emergence of <span class="taxon">tularensis</span>. Repeated observations showed that on
nights when the moon was not visible, adult rats usually emerged from their burrows
as soon as it became quite dark after the sun had set. On the contrary, when the moon
was full, or near that stage, and shining brightly at the time time the sun set, they did not
appear on the surface until the moon had almost disappeared in the west, even though
this was in the early morning hours.</p>
    <p>On one moonlight night, a kangaroo rat burrow was watched from sundown until
<span id="page128">Page 128</span>
midnight; no mammal was seen to emerge. At 4 oâ€™clock, about one hour before the moon
was to set, watch was again resumed. About 20 minutes before the moon disappeared
behind the hills to the west, the drumming sometimes made by kangaroo rats before
emerging was heard. One and one-half minutes later a kangaroo rat emerged and began
its foraging. On nights when the moon is considerably less than full, or when it is partly
obscured by clouds, activity usually goes on as it does on nights when the moon is not
visible. Evidently light intensity on a clear, full moonlight night is above the maximum
tolerated by this mammal for normal emergence from its burrow.</p>
    <p>The location of the burrow also affects the time of emergence of the occupant; when
under a tree, beside a rock, or otherwise situated so that it may be shaded from the light
of the sun or moon, the animal comes out earlier than from unshaded burrows. For
example, a burrow under the east edge of a rock outcrop, or on the east slope of a hill
would be first to come in the shadow of the setting sun, so that the minimum of darkness
required by the occupant for emergence would, on a moonless night, occur earlier
than it would at a burrow situated in the open or under the western edge of a rock
outcrop. The occupant of one burrow at the base of a medium-size willow tree emerged,
on the average, ten minutes earlier than did the occupant of an adjacent burrow in the
open beyond the shadow of the willow. It was darker under the willow than it was in
the open; the tree cast a definite shadow from the reflected rays of the sun which had
dropped behind the horizon. After emerging, the rat moved about freely under the
willow, but did not venture beyond the shadow until after a kangaroo rat in the burrow
in the open had emerged and begun foraging.</p>
    <p>On moonless nights, activity above ground in the open usually begins between 20
and 30 minutes past sundown; the occupants of 16 out of 21 burrows watched under such
conditions first emerged at this time. Although some individuals may intermittently
forage above ground throughout a dark night, repeated observations have shown that,
as a rule, the majority of individuals forage above ground in two fairly well-defined
periods in the early part of the night. For about 40 minutes after their first emergence a
majority of the rats spend most of the time on the surface, unless they become alarmed
and enter their burrows, where they remain for indefinite periods. After this forty-minute
period, most of them enter burrows and remain there for as long as four hours.
When they again emerge, the period of activity varies. Sometimes, it amounts to only
a few minutes; at other times they are on the surface intermittently for as long as four
hours, but generally after the second emergence, they are inactive for the remainder
of the night.</p>
    <p>On nights when a bright moon is absent for only a short time in the early morning
hours, activity is concentrated in the period of greatest darkness. If the moon rises
late, causing the period of greatest darkness to come in the early part of the night, activity
is apparently no more concentrated then than it is in the early parts of nights
that are without moonlight at any time.</p>
    <p>Immature animals react to light conditions differently than do adults. They tend
to be more erratic, and less cautious, often foraging in the moonlight when the adults
do not venture forth.</p>
    <p>Weather conditions also influence the time of activity above ground. Rain fell during
all or part of three nights when observations were made. No surface activity was
observed during the rains or immediately following them, even though the night in each
case was moonless. When a light rain stopped in the early part of the night, the occupant
of a burrow I was watching emerged only after the slick surface film of mud
about the vicinity of the burrow entrance had dried. The evidence that the Tulare
kangaroo rat is inactive on the surface during rain or heavy fog is supported by the fact
that out of more than 300 trap nights when such conditions prevailed, no kangaroo
rats were taken. <a href="litcited.xhtml#vorhies_and_taylor-1922">Vorhies and Taylor</a> (1922, <abbr>p.</abbr> 13) noted that
<span class="taxon">Dipodomys spectabilis
<span id="page129">Page 129</span>
spectabilis</span> was inactive above ground on rainy nights, or when the ground was wet or
covered with snow, but <a href="litcited.xhtml#dale-1939">Dale</a> (1939, <abbr>p.</abbr> 716) found that
<span class="taxon">Dipodomys heermanni saxatilis</span>
was sometimes active on rainy nights, and he several times saw its tracks in the snow.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="subsurface" aria-label="Sub-surface Activity">
    <p><em>Sub-surface activity</em>.&#8212;The Tulare kangaroo rat normally spends approximately
twenty-three hours of each day within the confines of its burrow, but in a prolonged
rainy spell, it may spend several consecutive days and nights underground.</p>
    <p>These animals are more or less active within their burrows at all times of the year.
The characteristic thumping made by members of this genus occasionally can be heard
if one scrapes lightly around the burrow entrance. This thumping is more often heard
after night has fallen, but at times it can be heard in the daytime, indicating that they
may be awake, and more or less active, at all hours of the day.</p>
    <p>The many plugged tunnels within the burrow system are evidence, also, that these
animals carry on a certain amount of sub-surface activity, other than that involved
in the eating of stored food. On rainy nights, when the rats do not come out, they often
push fresh earth, mixed with food refuse, from the entrances to burrows.</p>

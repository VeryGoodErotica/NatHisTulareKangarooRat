  <section id="original" aria-labelledby="originalh2">
    <h2 id="originalh2">Canonical Journal Article</h2>
    <p>The article was originally published in <span class="jtitle">Journal of Mammalogy</span>, Volume 22, Issue 2, <time datetime="1941-05-14">14 May 1941</time>, Pages 117&#8211;148, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/1374908" title="Internet Link">https://doi.org/10.2307/1374908</a>. I refer to this as the <dfn>canonical journal article</dfn> elsewhere with some frequency within this ePub.</p>
    <p>If you are citing the work of Donald T. Tappe contained in this ePub, please cite the canonical journal article either instead of or in addition to this ePub. You should of course also verify the information in the canonical journal article as well before citing it.</p>

  <section id="port" aria-labelledby="porth2">
    <h2 id="porth2">ePub Port</h2>
    <p>The canonical journal article was ported manually by hand to ePub by Michael A. Peters for Pipfrosch Press, a new company started by Michael A. Peters with a specific goal of making natural history publications accessible to those with disabilities, whether those disabilities are the ‘traditional’ kind covered by the American for Disabilities Act, or whether they are the ‘societal’ kind, such as financial poverty or the lack of access to higher education. In my experience, ‘traditional’ disabilities often lead to ‘societal’ disabilities, our society needs to address both or our addressing of ‘traditional’ disabilities is incomplete. Pipfrosch Press hopes to help address those issues.</p>

  <section id="alterations" aria-labelledby="alterationsh2">
    <h2 id="alterationsh2">Alterations</h2>
    <p>In porting the canonical journal article to a responsive content ePub (responsive content is content that adapts to the available screen space without resulting in scrolling, sometimes referred to as flow-able content), I tried as much as possible to do so with accuracy. There are some noticeable changes</p>
    <p>Some changes were made for the purpose of content accessibility, you can read about the content accessibility in the <a href="accessibility.xhtml">Content Accesibility</a> appendix chapter.</p>
    <p>None of these changes should have a negative impact on the understanding of the article or the intent of the original author.</p>
    
    <section id="floats" aria-labelledby="floatsh3">
      <h3 id="floatsh3">Floats</h3>
      <p>Tables, Figures, and Plates (floats) were moved to the end of the article.</p>
      <p>Within the canonical journal article itself, they often were placed in the middle of paragraphs and in some cases, in the middle of paragraphs of logical sections the floats were not directly applicable to.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="abbreviations" aria-labelledby="abbrh3">
      <h3 id="abbrh3">Hyperlink Abbreviations</h3>
      <p>Where the original author uses an abbreviation such as &#8216;<abbr>pl.</abbr> 1&#8217; within text that has been turned into a hyperlink within the ePub, I expanded the abbreviation.</p>
      <p>The reason for this, on touch-screen devices with very short linked text, it can be difficult for some users to select the link accurately without the device mis-interpreting the action for a different gesture.</p>

    <h2 id="motivationh2">Motivation</h2>
    <p>While working on the Contra Costa County ePub field guide, what I hope will be the flagship publication of Pipfrosch Press, I wanted to include as much information on the presumed extinct Berkeley Kangaroo Rat <span class="taxon">(Dipodomys heermanni berkeleyensis)</span> as I could in hopes that someone finds and reports a remnant population.</p>
    <p>There is not much natural history about that species that has been published, so to adequately describe it within the field guide, I needed to look up what was published about its closest relative&#8212;the Tulare Kangaroo Rat.</p>
    <p>Getting access to this paper was difficult. I am financially poor, the <abbr>USD</abbr> $39.00 that JSTOR wanted was really out of my range, that is roughly <em>twice</em> the cost of most field guides, for which there are many I still need.</p>
    <p>Getting to libraries is difficult for me. I am not allowed to drive for medical reasons and spending hours on public transportation to get to one is a risk I can not take when I can not afford the medical bill that catching the Corona Virus would potentially cost to treat.</p>
    <p>When I finally did get access to the paper, the detail the author put into the paper really blew me away. I learned a lot, and I believe after reading it that I have a better chance of potentially recognizing a Berkeley Kangaroo Rat burrow system should I stumble upon in the Mount Diablo Foothills. I am also now motivated to try looking for evidence in owl pellets, as the author pointed out how often he found evidence of them in owl pellets.</p>
    <p>A goal of my Pipfrosch Press idea has always been to publish ePub versions of Public Domain natural history accounts. I was planning to start with Baird &amp; Girard species descriptions from the 19th century which are without a doubt part of the Public Domain. However when I read this article, if this article can be made accessible to naturalists in the Bay Area in a digital format that is easy to read on devices like smart phones where <abbr>PDF</abbr> has serious usability issues, <em>maybe</em> it will aid in the discovery of a remnant population that can be preserved.</p>
    <p>Extinction is forever, if a remnant population does exist, wildlife management has to know about it so they can monitor and protect it.</p>

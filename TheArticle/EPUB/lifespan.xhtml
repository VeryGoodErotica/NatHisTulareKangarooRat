  <p>From information at hand, it appears that the Tulare kangaroo rat may normally live
at least two years. A female, taken on <time datetime="1938-02-15">February 15, 1938</time>, was recaptured
<time datetime="1939-10-08">October 8, 1939</time>,
nearly 20 months later. She appeared to be full grown when first captured, and
when recaptured, she was active and appeared to be in good condition. Individuals
have been kept in cages for as long as 18 months, even though such rats were already full
grown when first caged.</p>

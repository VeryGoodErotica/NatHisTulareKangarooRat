  <h1 id="growthh1">Growth, Development and Behavior of Young</h1>
  <p>The young rats were watched and photographed, and changes in growth were recorded
at regular intervals (see <a href="figure2.xhtml">figure 2</a> and <a href="figure3.xhtml">figure 3</a>, <a href="table5.xhtml">table 5</a>,
and <a href="plate2.xhtml">plate 2 a&#8211;g</a>). At birth, they weighed 3.40,
3.50, 3.80 and 3.90 grams. Except for a decrease when 17 and 18 days old, and another
decrease when one month old, they gained steadily in weight. When born, tail and
hind legs were bent forward and pressed close to the under side of the body. The hind
limbs were about one-third longer than the front ones, and only slightly heavier, whereas
in the adult kangaroo rat they are approximately two and one-half times as long. At
birth the tail was relatively short, slightly more than one-half the length of the head
<span id="page137" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="137"/>
and body, whereas the tail of the adult is almost one and one-half times as long as the
head and body. For the first five days the tails of the young were semi-prehensile; when
the undersurface was touched with a probe, the tail was curled part way around it.
During the first 17 days the length of the head and body almost doubled, and the length
of the tail and the length of the hind feet tripled. At 17 days of age the hind feet were
about three-fourths the length of those of the adult, the body about one-half, and the
tail about one-third. When the young were about sixteen days old, the lengths of the
tail and body were increasing at approximately the same rate, but after one month, the
length of the tail increased faster than the length of head and body. At birth, the
hallux was relatively large and appeared as a fleshy protuberance; the toe nails were
short, soft, and bled if clipped. By the time the young were ten days old the nails could
be clipped without bleeding.</p>
  <p>The pinnae of the ears, which were laid over the meatus at birth, gradually became
erect and by the fifteenth day their shape resembled that in the adult. The auditory
and mastoidal bullae were relatively small, compared with the development of these
parts of the skull of the adult. The external ears, which were closed at birth, opened
on the sixteenth day, and the young, for the first time, reacted to the click of a camera.</p>
  <p>At birth the eyes were about three millimeters in diameter and closed by a covering
of thin skin, through which the pupil appeared as a pink dot about one millimeter in
diameter. A shallow horizontal groove, which crossed the center of the upper half of
the eye, marked the point of future separation of the eyelids. On the fourteenth day
a one-half millimeter break near the middle of this groove showed that the eye of
the male was beginning to open. By the fifteenth day the eyes of the three females, and
the left eye of the male had opened; the right eye of the male opened on the sixteenth
day. When in the open position, the eyelids were held about one-half millimeter apart
at the widest point; they were not spread wide apart, as in the adult.</p>
  <p>Newly born rats had prominent, unpigmented vibrissae which at that time apparently
are the most highly developed of the sense organs. If they are functional as tactile
organs at this early age, they probably aid the young rats in locating the mammae of the
female. It may be that the sense organs reach functional maturity in the order of
their use; the location of the nipples of the mother is probably the first direct action
taken by young rats.</p>
  <p>The upper incisors of the male and the two largest females broke through the gums
on the eleventh day. In the smallest member of the litter the lower incisors appeared
on the eleventh day and the upper incisors on the twelfth. On the eighteenth day the
color of the incisor teeth had changed from a pearly white to a dingy yellow. This
possibly was associated with the concurrent change from a milk to a partly solid diet.</p>
  <p>The external genitalia of male and female could be differentiated first on the ninth
day by the fact that in the male a swelling appeared on either side and a reddened ridge
extended back from the prepuce. The swellings and ridge were lacking in the females.</p>
  <p>When born, the young were moist, but they dried within a few minutes. The skin
was bright pink, wrinkled, and hairless. Cranial sutures and blood vessels, especially
the femoral, caudal, and the vessels on the top of the head, were clearly visible through
the thin skin. At 22 hours of age, a faint darkening on the rump and shoulders indicated
that pigmentation had begun in the developing hairs. By the fourth day, pigmentation
had spread over the head, back, and on the tail; the limbs were the last parts of the
body to become pigmented. The parts of the skin that have white hair in the adult
remained unpigmented in the young. In <span class="taxon">tularensis</span>, pigmentation apparently begins to
set in at an earlier age than in <span class="taxon">Dipodomys spectabilis</span>; Bailey
(<a href="litcited.xhtml#bailey-1931">1931, <abbr>p.</abbr> 255</a>) says that the
backs and heads of the latter began to darken at three days of age. In <span class="taxon">tularensis</span> the
dead, outer layer of skin began to scale off on the fourth day. Pigmentation continued
to grow heavier over the entire dorsal region so that by the sixth day the cranial sutures
<span id="page138" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="138"/>
could no longer be seen, and on the seventh day pigmentation began to appear on the
soles of the hind feet. Unpigmented skin on a swollen area on each side of the nose,
where the vibrissae arise, remained a bright pink, similar to the color of the skin at birth,
while the remainder of the unpigmented skin had by the seventh day become a dull pink.
<span id="page139" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="139"/>
As dorsal pigmentation progressed, the dermal gland appeared as an elongated,
smooth-surfaced, unpigmented spot on the mid-line of the back; it did not have a roughened
surface as in adults.</p>
  <p>Except for the vibrissae, the newly born young were naked. On the third day, fine
hair appeared on the back and top of the head. By the ninth day the pigmented areas
of the skin were thickly covered with the fine, dark gray-brown hairs of the juvenal
pelage; the unpigmented areas of the body were less densely covered with fine white
hairs. The dark and light areas of hair in the young rats corresponded to the same
colored areas on adults. By the ninth day the distal part of the tail was covered with
fine, short hairs for a distance of six millimeters back from the tip, but the remainder of
the tail appeared hairless to the naked eye. On the twelfth day the brown-tipped hairs
of the postjuvenal pelage appeared on the top of the head. By the fourteenth day the
new hairs appeared on the shoulders, and by the fifteenth day the new hairs were thinly
scattered over the back and rump. By the nineteenth day the new pelage had almost
<span id="page140" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="140"/>
replaced the darker juvenal pelage on the entire dorsal part of the body. When two
months old, the rats appeared much like adults, except that the pelage on the back and
hips had more of a grayish cast.</p>
  <p>Cheek pouches at birth were shallow, crescent-shaped folds in the skin. These
gradually deepened, until on the nineteenth day they were 10 millimeters deep.</p>
  <p>The most common sound emitted by the young rats was a &#8220;buzzing&#8221; squeak, made
with the mouth closed. This was heard from their birth until the nineteenth day,
usually when they were separated from their mother, or when hungry. When the young
were sixteen days old, they were placed outside the nest box, allowing the mother to
remain inside. The young began to squeak loudly, but the mother paid no attention to
them. After about one minute, a young female walked a distance of twelve inches
directly to the box, and entered through the two-inch entrance. Two others followed
within another a minute. After three had entered, the fourth crawled over to the box
and began to encircle it, apparently looking for the entrance. After crawling to within
one inch of the entrance, the young turned and crawled to the opposite side of the box,
all the time squeaking lustily. After several minutes of wandering back and forth
without finding the entrance, it became completely confused, and started to wander all
<span id="page142" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="142"/>
over the cage. After thirty minutes of such aimless wandering, during which time it
squeaked continuously, it was placed in the nest with the mother, whereupon it
immediately became quiet. Another sound made by the young was a somewhat musical
&#8220;chirp,&#8221; first heard on the seventh day and rarely thereafter. The third type of sound
was a rattling squeak of low pitch and slight volume, heard from about the eighteenth to
the twenty-fifth day when the young chewed at objects, or rarely when they walked
about.</p>
  <p>Newly born young apparently were unable to maintain a constant body temperature;
when taken from the mother, they soon became cold to the touch. As they became older,
they gradually acquired control of the body temperature and when one week of age they
could be left in the open for an hour or more without apparent chilling. Possibly
associated with this lack of control of body temperature was the behavior of the young
when they were placed under a photoflood light to photograph them. They would instantly
squirm and kick violently until the warm light was applied, then they would instantly
quiet down and go to sleep. By the time they were ten days old, however, the application
of the light had the opposite effect, making them wriggle more violently.</p>
  <p>The female spent most of the first day after the birth of her young in a corner of the
cage, leaving them inside the nest. At irregular intervals she retired to the nest where
she &#8220;brooded&#8221; her young for various lengths of time, usually for about 15 minutes, after
which she would again leave them. When 18 hours old, the young were found nursing
for the first time, but they may have nursed before this. After the first day the young
were found attached to the nipples of the mother each time the litter was inspected, but
on the seventeenth day they were found clinging to her only twice in ten inspections.
The young clung so tightly to the nipples that when the mother was raised, the young
were raised with her. While being suckled, the mother sat with her hind legs spread wide
apart, allowing room for the young to get to her mammae. Two positions were
commonly assumed by the young rats when suckling. In the position most used, they lay on
their backs (see <a href="plate2.xhtml#j">plate 2j</a>), while in the other, they lay on their bellies and bent their heads
backward to reach the nipples. Weaning appeared to be a gradual process that began
when the young first started to take solid food on the seventeenth day and ended
on the twenty-fifth day.</p>
  <p>At birth, the young rats were almost helpless, but by the third day they were able to
move about readily by crawling on their bellies; at this age their legs were not strong
enough to support them. One individual, while attempting to climb an inclined plane,
kicked violently simultaneously with both hind feet when unable to proceed with the
usual belly-crawl; this was the first suggestion of bipedal locomotion. On the seventh
day they were able to support the fore parts of their bodies with their front legs, and on
the tenth day their hind legs became functional. They then were able to move slowly
about by walking in a quadrupedal fashion, with the entire sold of the hind foot in
contact with the ground. As the body moved forward, they alternately raised each hind
foot, heel first, until the toes were the only part of the foot in contact with the ground.
The tail was dragged. On the fourteenth day they were able to stand on their hind feet
alone. In assuming this bipedal position, the rear feet were spread far apart, and the
entire sole of each hind foot was on the ground. The front feet were held under the jaws,
as is done by the adult. After this, a semi-bipedal method of locomotion gradually
replaced the quadrupedal walk, until by the twentieth day, the young moved almost
exclusively in this way. By the twenty-fifth day they were able to hop in the true
bipedal fashion of the adult, but this method at first was used sparingly.</p>
  <p>When the young were forty days old, they, with their mother, were taken to Porterville,
in the San Joaquin Valley, where they were placed in an outdoor cage measuring
4&#189; feet wide, by 1&#189; feet high, by 6&#189; feet long. The wire bottom was buried under six
inches of fine, sandy-loam soil. The adult dug a tunnel in which she and the young
<span id="page143" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="143"/>
stayed during the daytime. The young did not dig tunnels at this age (40 days),
although they occasionally did dig small pits by scratching out the soil with their front
feet. When two months old, they did more digging; often they would dig tunnels six or
eight inches long into the soft floor of the cage. When 78 days old, the young died during
a period of excessive heat. For several days previously, the temperature of the air
had remained well over one hundred degrees Fahrenheit during the middle of the day.
<span id="page144" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="144"/>
It is possible that this was a factor in causing premature death, as the young, when found
dead, were together in a tunnel, the ceiling of which was about three and one-half inches
below the surface of the ground. This thickness of soil probably was insufficient to
furnish the required amount of insulation.</p>
  <section id="age" aria-label="Age at which young leave burrows">
    <p><em>Age at which young leave burrows</em>.&#8212;The age of young taken in the field was calculated
by comparing the weight and body measurements of such young, with that of young
reared in captivity. Using this method of determining age, trapping data indicate that
young rats normally leave the burrows in which they were born at about six weeks of
age. The youngest appearing individual taken by me weighed 24.3 grams, but one
specimen of <span class="taxon">tularensis</span> in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology weighed only 23.5 grams
and measured 218 <abbr>mm.</abbr> (total length), 127 <abbr>mm.</abbr> (tail), 40 <abbr>mm.</abbr> (hind foot), and 12 <abbr>mm.</abbr>
(ear). The corresponding parts of another museum specimen, whose weight was not
indicated, measured 189, 104, 38, and 8 millimeters. No record is known to exist of a
smaller specimen than this being taken in traps. Young rats may, under unusual
circumstances, leave the burrow much earlier than at six weeks of age. Dixon (<abbr>MS</abbr>, 1918)
found four young <span class="taxon">tularensis</span> at the base of an <span class="taxon">Atriplex</span> bush. One of them had been dead
for a day or more, but the others were alive and squirming about. These rats did not
yet have their eyes open, and moved by squirming on their bellies. Dixon believed that
the mother had been trapped and the young had managed to squirm out of the nest and
had wandered about in search of her.</p>

    <p><em>Tail growth-coefficient</em>.&#8212;Huxley
(<a href="litcited.xhtml#huxley-1932"><time>1932</time></a>) has derived a formula for determining relative

a constant, is the ratio of the relative
growth-rate of the organ to the relative growth-rate of the body. Huxley
(<a href="litcited.xhtml#huxley-1932"><abbr class="italic">op. cit.</abbr>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 10</a>)
says of this formula, &#8220;if the logarithms of the magnitudes are plotted, we should
expect a straight line, from the slope of which the value of

can be read off.&#8221; In order
to see how closely the growth of the tail of the kangaroo rat approximates this formula
of constant differential growth ratio, a curve was made by plotting logarithms of the
linear tail growth measurements against logarithms of the linear body growth measurements
(see <a href="figure4.xhtml"><abbr>fig.</abbr> 4</a>). This curve is a relatively straight line, showing that the growth of the
tail of this rodent does approximate his formula. The growth-coefficient

of young kangaroo rats is 1.73, as calculated by Huxley’s method.</p>

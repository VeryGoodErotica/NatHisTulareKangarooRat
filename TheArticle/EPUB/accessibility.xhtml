  <h1 id="a11yh1">Content Accessibility</h1>
  <p>This appendix chapter is unrelated to the academic journal content within this ePub. This appendix chapter exists to explain why the ePub port of the canonical journal article when a JSTOR <abbr>PDF</abbr> already exists is so important.</p>
  <p>In content publishing, <dfn>Accessibility</dfn> (often abbreviated as <abbr>a11y</abbr>&#8212;the letter ‘a’ followed by eleven other letters and ending with the letter ‘y’) is the discipline of identifying access barriers that prevent someone with a disability from being able to access the content, and taking the appropriate measures to provide a means for the impacted users to overcome those barriers.</p>
  <p>In many cases there are laws that <em>require</em> content producers to take some steps towards content accessibility, but these laws are civil laws and so they are very rarely actually enforced unless the people impacted by the accessibility barrier have both the financial means and the emotional strength to file a lawsuit, and then companies often only do the bare minimum that is required to meet the letter of the law.</p>
  <p>At Pipfrosch Press, we hold the unequivocal position that content accessibility should be the highest priority of the publisher. Not to avoid lawsuits, but because we see people who experience barriers to content accessibility as human beings worthy of dignity and respect. Lawsuits should be rare because publishers should take the necessary steps to make their content accessible simply because <em>it is the right thing to do</em>.</p>
  <p>A common misconception about accessibility is that documents which work reasonably well with a screen reader are accessible.</p>
  <p>It certainly can be said that a document which does not work well with a screen reader is not accessible, but the converse is not true. Screen readers do address certain access barriers but they do not address all access barriers. Furthermore when a document does work with a screen reader, <em>how well it works</em> with a screen reader frequently can be dramatically improved.</p>
  <p>Automated tests can not adequately validate the accessibility of a document. Businesses like automated tests because they are cheap t run, and they do have value, but numerous documents will serious accessibility issues pass automated tests with flying colors.</p>
  <p>I literally hate the fact that many automated tests will declare a document to be <abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2.0 AA compliant. Such declarations from an automated test is dishonest, and one should question the integrity of the programming as a result. Only a human trained in content accessibility can adequately determine if a document meets a particularly accessibility standard level.</p>
  <p>Just as an example, without tagging a bibliography as a bibliography, I can create a bibliography using a simple <abbr>HTML</abbr> definition list that visually works just fine as a bibliography and screen readers would read it just fine. The document that contains this kind of bibliography would pass ePub accessibility tests with flying colors. In fact that is how I use to create a bibliography in ePub before I knew better and automated tests never complained, but it is not as accessible as it should be because it is not properly tagged as a bibliography so that part is not validated according to bibliography accessibility standards.</p>
  <p>Automated tests do serve a very useful purpose but they should only be seen as <em>part</em> of the process of evaluating the accessibility of a document.</p>

    <h2 id="academicsh2">Accessibility of Academic Papers</h2>
    <p>In the academic journal world, content accessibility has improved considerably during the last twenty years, but it is still highly problematic <em>especially</em> for journal articles published during the twentieth century, including the journal article that has been converted to the ePub format here.</p>
    <p>The rest of this appendix chapter details the accessibility steps that Pipfrosch Press has taken to provide radically increased content accessibility for the journal article in this ePub over the very expensive version that is available through JSTOR.</p>
    <p>Please understand that despite what we see as flaws in the service JSTOR provides, we do have a very high respect for them.</p>
    <p>From the JSTOR website:</p>
    <blockquote>
    We have made every effort to ensure that our image-based PDF files are accessible and can be read with screen readers like JAWS. These files are tagged at a high level using an automated process. While this method is not exact, it dramatically increases the accessibility of the files as compared to an untagged version.
    </blockquote>
    <span class="blockquote"><a href="https://about.jstor.org/accessibility/" title="Internet Resource">https://about.jstor.org/accessibility/</a></span>
    <p>Please note these two portions of the above quote:</p>
    <ol class="italic">
      <li>&#8230;tagged at a high level using an <em>automated process</em>.</li>
      <li>&#8230;dramatically increases the accessibility of the files <em>as compared to an untagged version</em>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Automated tagging will produce image-based <abbr>PDF</abbr> files that are more accessible than the same file without tagging but they are still <strong>severely</strong> lacking in accessibility. The JSTOR process very well may meet the letter of the law, but it does not adequately meet the needs of many users.</p>

  <section id="flowable" aria-labelledby="flowableh2">
    <h2 id="flowableh2">Flowable Content</h2>
    <p>JSTOR uses fixed-layout <abbr>PDF</abbr> for the vast majority if not all of its historic journal content. A <abbr>PDF</abbr> can be cheaply created by scanning a printed journal, perfectly preserving the pagination that is often referred to by other journal articles.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately <abbr>PDF</abbr> is a fixed-layout design. When a user with a vision disability needs to increase the displayed font size in order to access the content, a <abbr>PDF</abbr> increases proportionally in both width and height. This often results in the need for the user to both horizontally scroll and vertically scroll in order to access the content, which is highly problematic.</p>
    <p>Pipfrosch Press has chosen ePub for digital content publishing because it is a <em>flowable</em> layout. When a user needs to increase the font size, it does not result in scrolling in either direction. The number of page turns does increase, but scrolling is avoided.</p>
    <section id="pagination" aria-labelledby="paginationh3">
      <h3 id="paginationh3">Journal Article Pagination</h3>
      <p>With a flowable-layout, the concept of specific referable page numbers has to be emulated. This is accomplished using the method described in the DAISY Consortium ‘<a href="http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/navigation/pagelist.html" title="Internet Resource">Page Navigation</a>’ Accessible Publishing Knowledge Base.</p>
      <p>Pipfrosch Press implements that method, allowing users to both discover the journal page they are currently reading and allowing users to jump to the equivalent of a specific journal page.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately not all ePub readers make this pagination feature available to the user, but many do.</p>

  <section id="transcription" aria-labelledby="transcriptionh2">
    <h2 id="transcriptionh2">Text Transcription</h2>
    <p>With the JSTOR version of the canonical journal article, they did at least run the pages through <abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> technology so that the images of the text in the journal article could be tagged with the text strings, allowing screen readers to read the paper. Unfortunately they did not finish the job.</p>
    <p>I can forgive them not distinguishing between a hyphen (-), en-dash (&#8211;), and em-dash (&#8212;); but they did not even use a basic spell checker to determine where the <abbr>OCR</abbr> technology failed.</p>
    <p>Just as an example, at one location in the scanned image I could see there was stray ink above a lower case <span ssml:ph="ō">‘o’</span>. I predicted it would be scanned as as an <span ssml:ph="ˈsərkəmˌfleks ō">‘ô’</span> or an <span ssml:ph="ˈˈo͝omˌlout ō">‘ö’</span>. I was wrong, the <abbr>OCR</abbr> technology interpreted it as a <span ssml:ph="siks">‘6’</span>.</p>
    <p>I do not understand why they can not run the output of the <abbr>OCR</abbr> through a basic spelling checker and have a human check the output against the scanned image where a spelling error is detected. That would catch cases like this.</p>
    <p>When transcribing the canonical journal article to ePub, I was <em>very</em> careful to make sure I did an accurate job. It is possible there are mistakes, but I doubt there are as many transcription issues as there are with the JSTOR <abbr>PDF</abbr>.</p>
    <p>With the ePub format, it is also very easy for almost anyone to correct any transcription mistakes I did make, the source <abbr>XHTML</abbr> files can be modified with a simple text editor.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="tts" aria-labelledby="ttsh2">
    <h2 id="ttsh2">Pronunciation Lexicon</h2>
    <p>The JSTOR <abbr>PDF</abbr> for the canonical journal article does not include any pronunciation lexicons. To be fair, I do not believe <abbr>PDF</abbr> has that capability, though I could be wrong about that.</p>
    <p>The ePub standard provides two pronunciation lexicon methods for helping a Text to Speech (<abbr>TTS</abbr>) synthesizer accurately read a document.</p>
    <p><abbr title="Pronunciation Lexicon Specification">PLS</abbr> is a <abbr>W3C</abbr> specification for specifying one or more spellings of a word and how that word should phonetically be pronounced. It is used a stand-alone file within an ePub for cases where the same spelling should <em>always</em> be pronounced the same way. This is very useful for scientific journal articles which frequently contain technical terms, including taxonomical names, that <abbr>TTS</abbr> synthesizers have trouble correctly pronouncing.</p>
    <p>The second method is <abbr title="Speech Synthesis Markup Language">SSML</abbr>, which provides the same function but is used in cases where it is better to mark up the specific use case to be pronounced a certain way. For example, ‘I had to <span ssml:ph="kōks">coax</span> the <span ssml:ph="ˈkōaks">coax</span> through the hole.’ In that case, the proper pronunciation of the letters ‘<span ssml:ph="sē ō ā eks">c-o-a-x</span>’ can not be determinned from the letters alone, so <abbr>SSML</abbr> would be a better choice to mark up that word. In that particular example, some (but not all) <abbr>TTS</abbr> synthethizers are actually smart enough to determine if the word is being used as a verb or a noun and may not need phonetic markup, but hopefully that example still conveys the point of where <abbr>SSML</abbr> is a better choice than <abbr>PLS</abbr>.</p>
    <p>I make use of both <abbr>PLS</abbr> and <abbr>SSML</abbr>, depending upon which is choice I deem to be better for the specific use case. When a user needs <abbr>TTS</abbr> to access content, they should not be considered to be second-class citizens where it is deemed okay for many of the words to be read to them incorrectly.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately at this this time, very few ePub readers actually implement either solution, but I am aware of at one custom reader used by an educational facility in Japan that does implement phonetic markup in ePub. Hopefully more will come in the future. One of the reasons reader implementation is almost non-existent is that ePub usage of phonetic lexicons is low, but one of the reasons ePub usage of lexicons is low is because the implementation in readers is not there. Both of those need to change.</p>
    <p>With <abbr>SSML</abbr> I am using the International Phonetic Alphabet (<abbr>IPA</abbr>). Unfortunately with <abbr>SSML</abbr> only one phonetic alphabet can be used at a time.</p>
    <p>With <abbr>PLS</abbr> I am using <abbr>IPA</abbr> as the defined alphabet but also provide <abbr title="Extended Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet">X-SAMPA</abbr> as a fall-back alternative just in case a <abbr>TTS</abbr> sysnthesizer supports <abbr>X-SAMPA</abbr> but does not support <abbr>IPA</abbr>.</p>

  <section id="fonts" aria-labelledby="fontsh2">
    <h2 id="fontsh2">Fonts and Justification</h2>
    <p>With a <abbr>PDF</abbr> created from scanning a printed document, the font can not be changed, what you see is actually an image. With some <abbr>PDF</abbr> documents the font can be changed, but it looks horrible if the replacement font does not have identical font metrics. In either case, text justification can not be changed.</p>
    <p>The canonical journal article was published using a serif font, either Times or a derivative of Times.</p>
    <p>Reasearch has shown that serif fonts are particularly hard for people with dyslexia to read. Dyslexia is a complex spectrum and there is no ‘best font’ for dyslexia but sans-serif fonts in general are a far better choice for reducing the impact of dyslexia.</p>
    <p>Serif fonts also cause eye and brain fatigue in many of us who are not dyslexic, myself included. The problem seems to be worse on computer screens than in print, my <em>guess</em> is because computer screens tend to have a much lower <abbr>DPI</abbr> resolution than printing presses, but that is speculatory.</p>
    <p>Eye and brain fatigue results in reduced reading comprehension, headaches, and in my case, an increased liklihood of an epilepric seizure. To be accessible, digital content <em>must</em> allow the user to change the font used to one that does not result in eye and brain fatigue.</p>    
    <p>In the JSTOR <abbr>PDF</abbr> it is simply not possible to alter the font used. In an ePub document, changing the font used is relatively easy. Many ePub readers allow the user to override the publisher specified font family without even needing to modify the ePub.</p>
    <p>With ePub documents published by Pipfrosch Press, the Intel&#174; <a href="https://01.org/clear-sans" title="Internet Resource">Clear Sans</a> font was chosen. I chose that family for two reasons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>It uses a non-royalty free software license that explicitly allows redistribution.</li>
      <li>It is by far the easiest font on my eyes that I have used in a digital context that allows free redistribution.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The sans-serif Apple fonts that currently ship with Apple devices are also extremely easy on my eyes but Apple does not allow their redistribution.</p>
    <p>The Fira Sans originally created for the Firefox <abbr>OS</abbr> meets the first requirement, but I found that my eyes tire with it as well. Looking at the font in a font editor, it uses fancy curves with the font stems, and I wonder if that is the issue. I do not know.</p>
    <p>I wanted Fira Sans to work because it has a small-caps variant, but it tired my eyes out too quickly. Not as quicklY as serif fonts do, but quickly enough.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, at least for me personally, on eInk devices virtually any sans-serif fonts works well for me. It is only with the <abbr>LCD</abbr> displays used on computer monitors and ‘smart devices’ where my eyes tend to be picky. This ePub has been tested on a Kobo Clara <abbr>HD</abbr> (available from Walmart) specifically to make sure it works for those who prefer eInk devices. There are some issues with the rendering of the <abbr>SVG</abbr> figures, those issues are being worked on and hopefully will be resolved soon.</p>
    <p>Due to the fact that Clear Sans does not have a small-caps variant, Pipfrosch Press does not currently use small-caps even when reproducing an upstream paper that did so.</p>
    <p>With respect to justified text, the majoroty of academic journals use justified text. Pipfrosch Press does not specify justified text. For most people on small screens, justified text is actually harder to read even though it looks beautiful. Beautiful typesetting misses the point of typesetting if it decreases the readability of the content.</p>
    <p>Many ePub readers allow the user to specify justified text if that is what the user prefers, and some even default to justified text.</p>
    <p>The main point is though that with ePub, the user can easily select a different font to be used and the user can easily decide whether or not they want the text justified, allowing the user to easily remove accessibility barriers that might otherwise exist but can not be altered in a <abbr>PDF</abbr> document.</p>
    <p>In some cases, changing the font may change how text in an <abbr>SVG</abbr> figure aligns. To reduce the impact of that happening, the font specified for use in <abbr>SVG</abbr> is specified differently than for the body content. At least some ePub readers (inluding the previously mentioned Kobo Clara <abbr>HD</abbr>) are smart enough to then allow changing the body font while preserving the font defined for use in the <abbr>SVG</abbr> figures.</p>

  <section id="navigation" aria-labelledby="navigationh2">
    <h2 id="navigationh2">Content Navigation</h2>
    <p>In order for a digital document to be accessible, it <strong>MUST</strong> have a means for navigating the document that assistive technology such as a screen reader can properly utilize.</p>
    <p><abbr>PDF</abbr> has this capability and this is an area where modern journal papers published within the last twenty years often do things properly, but where the JSTOR <abbr>PDF</abbr> for the canonical journal article ported to ePub here completely fails.</p>
    <p>Instead of using the <abbr>PDF</abbr> digital Table of Contents to provide navigation within the canonical journal article, it is used for a table of contents to the journal issue where <strong>EVERY EVERY INCLUDING THE ARTICLE IN THE PDF</strong> is a link to JSTOR. Personally I find that inexcusable.</p>
    <p>Pipfrosch Press properly uses the content navigation facilities that ePub makes available to assistive technology.</p>
    <p>In addition to a visual hierarchical Table of Contents that appears after preface, machine parsible navigation content lists that allow for
<span role="list">
  <span role="listitem">landmark navigation,</span>
  <span role="listitem">hierarchical sequential ‘spine’ navigation for every section included in the ePub,</span>
  <span role="listitem">table navigation,</span>
  <span role="listitem">figure navigation,</span>
  <span role="listitem">illustration navigation,</span>
  <span role="listitem">and navigation by canonical journal article page number</span>
</span>
are provided. While not all ePub readers expose these navigation lists to viewers who are not using assistive technology, these lists use a standardized <abbr>API</abbr> that allows assistive technology to use these machine parsible navigation lists to help a user easily access the specific portion of the article the user wishes to navigate to.</p>
    <p>When a professor or research references a specific
<span role="list">
  <span role="listitem">page number,</span>
  <span role="listitem">table,</span>
  <span role="listitem">photographic plate,</span>
  <span role="listitem">or section</span>
</span>
within the canonical journal article, a user of assistive technology can easily navigate to that location within this ePub. They can not easily do so as easily within the JSTOR <abbr>PDF</abbr> <em>even though <abbr>PDF</abbr> supports the ability to do so</em>.</p>
    <p>JSTOR needs to fix this issue.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="tables" aria-labelledby="tablesh2">
    <h2 id="tablesh2">Tabular Data</h2>
    <p>The canonical journal article contains five different tables.</p>
    <p>When properly marked up, tabular data is not a problem for assistive technology. This is an area where academic <abbr>PDF</abbr> documents produced within the last twenty years has significantly improved.</p>
    <p>The tables in the JSTOR <abbr>PDF</abbr> are not properly marked up for accessibility.</p>
    <p>The reproduction of those tables in this ePub are properly marked up for accessibility, assistive technology can properly and meaningfully navigate the tabular data.</p>
    <p>Assistive technology access to the tabular data however is only <em>part</em> of proper accessibility.</p>
    <section id="epubtables" aria-labelledby="epubtablesh3">
      <h3 id="epubtablesh3">ePub Tabular Visual Access Barrier</h3>
      <p>When an ePub document is viewed on a small screen with a normal font size or on a moderate screen but with a very large font size, ePub viewers often fail miserably where <abbr>PDF</abbr> does not.</p>
      <p>I believe this is a design flaw in ePub viewers rather than in the ePub specification itself, but who is to blame does not really matter to the impacted users.</p>
      <p>When the data does not adequately fit in the horizontal space available, ePub viewers will squash some columns breaking up single words over multiple lines. What they <em>should</em> do provide for horizontal scrolling of the table without squashing the tabular data. There are several different ways this could be accomplished.</p>
      <p>My preferred mechanism would be to allow the user to click (or tap with a touchscreen) the table to view the table with side scrolling so that data columns are not overly compressed. Some viewers already provide this ability with images, even allowing the user to zoom in on the image.</p>
      <p>With tables it would have to be done carefully, table cells markes as headers with a scope of a table row should not horizontally scrow out of view, columns with such rows should have other columns horizontally scroll beneath them so that these headers containing columns, when present, are always visible. This would have to be thought out because sometimes a table footer contains a header with a row scope that spand many columns in the table body that are not headers.</p>
      <p>Another issue that exists is tables are often broken up into multiple pages because the rows will not all fit on a single screen. This problem is exasperated by row height being increased when cell data wraps multiple lines in order to squish it horizontally.</p>
      <p>What ePub readers <em>should</em> do is allow the table body elements to scroll between the table header and if present, the table footer. This way the table header and footer are always visible on large table and the user can vertically scroll the data rows between them.</p>
      <p>It would be nice if ePub viewers did these things when a table does not fit horizontally and/or vertically on the screen, but I am not aware of any that do.</p>
      <p>Using my Pixel 3XL as a testing device, I was able to reduce the impact of these issues with some of the tables.</p>
      <div role="list">
        <div role="listitem">
          <p>In the case of Table 1, no changes were necessary. With a standard font size on the Pixel 3XL, it fits on one page without any words being split across multiple lines.</p>
        </div>
        <div role="listitem">
          <p>With Table 2, horizontal compression impacts one of the table heading splitting several individual words across multiple lines, but none of the data cells were impacted.</p>
          <p>The table does require two pages but there is not anything I can do to make it fit on a single page on this device.</p>
        </div>
        <div role="listitem">
          <p>With Table 3, the table caption in the canonical journal article is extraordinarily long, consuming about &#188; of the available space on my Pixel 3XL.</p>
          <p>Table 3 also had a superfluous row in the table footer where the author simply showed the math for how the author obtained the results.</p>
          <p>By moving the very long caption into a ‘Table Description’ section directly following the table and using a much shorter summarized caption, in combination with removing the superfluous row from the table footer, I managed to get the entire table to fit on a single page on the Pixel 3XL.</p>
        </div>
        <div role="listitem">
          <p>With Table 4, no changes were made. It does use two pages on the Pixel 3XL but there are no changes that would reduce it to a single page.</p>
        </div>
        <div role="listitem">
          <p>Table 5 was the most problematic table on the Pixel 3XL as that table has seven columns and numerous rows, resulting is massive horizontal compression issues that impacted some of the data cells.</p>
          <p>The last five rows are all length measurements in millimeters, by combining the five identical ‘millimeter’ heading columns in the second row of the table header into a single cell that spans all five rows, and by moving the identical word ‘LENGTH’ from the last five header cells in the first row of the table header into the now single ‘millimeter’ heading columns in the second row, I was able to radically reduce the horizontal column compression issues.</p>
          <p>Additionally changing the ‘WEIGHT’ heading column to the abbreviation ‘<abbr>WT</abbr>’ and changing the ‘HIND FOOT’ heading column to the abbreviation ‘<abbr>H.F.</abbr>’ further reduced the horizontal column compression issue. Many data cells however still had their numerical data split across two lines. Reducing the font size for the numerical data cells <em>mostly</em> solved that issue, but it is still present.</p>
          <p>The table still used three pages on the Pixel 3XL. By moving the length table caption to its own ‘Table Description’ section directly following the table and using a much shorter summarized caption, I was able to reduce that to two pages.</p>
          <p>Table 5 still suffers from horizontal column compression:</p>
          <figure id="tbl5" aria-labelledby="tbl5figcap">
            <img src="auximg/ExTable5.png" alt="The column headers and first three rows of data from Table 5 as shown on a small-screen display. In the first column header row, the words ‘BODY’, ‘TOTAL’, and ‘EAR’ are each broken up to wrap two lines. In the second column header row, the words ‘days’, and ‘grams’ are each broken up to wrap two lines. In the data rows, multiple though a minority of data cells have the numerical value broken up at the decimal point to wrap two lines."/>
            <figcaption id="tbl5figcap">Screenshot of Table 5 on a small-screen device</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The problem however has been greatly reduced.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>In conclusion, ePub provides excellent support for tabular data when assistive technology is used.</p>
      <p>When assistive technology is not used, there are still some issues that need improvement by the ePub reader software developers, but those issues can at least be partially be reduced, and Pipfrosch Press is dedicated to doing so.</p>
      <p>On screen sizes and font size combinations where these issues exist, <abbr>PDF</abbr> is absolutely horrid and as a fixed-layout format, <abbr>PDF</abbr> really can not be fixed in that respect.</p>

  <section id="figures" aria-labelledby="figuresh2">
    <h2 id="figuresh2">Figures</h2>
    <p>With respect to figures, I still have a lot to learn about proper use of accessibility application programming interfaces for best results of assistive technology.</p>
    <p>Figures typically involves a graphical sketch or data graph, frequently but not always with text as part of the figure beyond just the caption for the figure.</p>
    <p>In modern academic journals, the actual figure is typically typeset from a vector source in the Encapsulated Postscript Format (<abbr>EPS</abbr>) or from another vector source that is easily translatable to <abbr>EPS</abbr>. The advantage to <abbr>EPS</abbr> is that it scales to whatever the needed size for rasterization at the resolution being printed or viewed.</p>
    <p>Within the ePub format, the supported vector image formage is Scalable Vector Graphics (<abbr>SVG</abbr>).</p>
    <p>In an ideal world when porting a <abbr>PDF</abbr> to ePub, the <abbr>EPS</abbr> or other vector source used for the <abbr>PDF</abbr> is directly converted to <abbr>SVG</abbr>. That is not possible with historic academic papers where the <abbr>PDF</abbr> is created by scanning the printed journal.</p>
    <p>With historic academic papers, the printed figures are scanned and will often have visual artificats as a result of rasterization at a different <abbr>DPI</abbr> that the resolution at which they were scanned. These visual artifacts are very noticeable in the JSTOR <abbr>PDF</abbr> for the canonical journal article.</p>
    <p>For the four figures present within the canonical journal article, rather than using the scanned rasterized figures I chose the labor intensive recreating them manually in <abbr>SVG</abbr>.</p>
    <p>When an <abbr>SVG</abbr> illustration is referenced in an ePub spine page using the <abbr>XHTML</abbr> <code>img</code> image tag, the accessibility markup is limited to what is available for bitmap image formats like <abbr>JPEG</abbr> and <abbr>PNG</abbr>.</p>
    <p>When an <abbr>SVG</abbr> illustration is embedded in the <abbr>XHTML</abbr> directly then additional accessibility interfaces are potentially available, and this is where my current ignorance on the topic lies. I still need to learn about both what these interfaces are, the best practices for their use, and whether or not current assistive technology even makes use of them in the context of an ePub document.</p>
    <p>Two of these interfaces are the <abbr>SVG</abbr> <code>title</code> node and the <abbr>SVG</abbr> description node. Their use is fairly self-explanatory.</p>
    <p>What I am <em>hoping</em> is that it is possible to do things like associate numerical text on a graph with which axis they are associated with and points on a graph with their coordinates even if the coordinates are not printed on the figure itself.</p>
    <p>If that level of accessibility tagging is possible in such a way that the user can <em>choose</em> whether or not they want the data conveyed to them, then I would like to do it. It may help some users without eyesight visualize graphical figures in their mind.</p>
    <p>At this point in time, the accessibility of the figures in this <abbr>PDF</abbr> are limited to text descriptions within the <abbr>SVG</abbr> <code>description</code> node, which is less accessibility than I would like but more accessibility than is provided by the JSTOR <abbr>PDF</abbr>.</p>
    <section id="fig1note" aria-labelledby="fig1noteh3">
      <h3 id="fig1noteh3">Figure 1 Note</h3>
      <p>Figure 1 in the canonical journal article was creating for monochrome printing, strictly black and white, not even grayscale.</p>
      <p>To indicate the range of <span class="taxon">Dipodomys heermanni</span> in general, diagonal lines sloping from north-west towards southeast were used. To indicate the range of <span class="taxon">Dipodomys heermanni tularensis</span> specifically, diagonal lines running from south-west towards northeast with less distance between them were used.</p>
      <p>For the time of publication, that was appropriate, but it creates a visual accessibility hazard. My eyes get fatigued rather quickly while looking at it, a result of the high contrast between the lines exasperated by the geographical features underneath the lines. You can actually see the effects of my mental fatigue with how sloppy my rendering of the San Francisco and San Pablo bay are, my brain was really worn out.</p>
      <p>When recreating Figure 1, I chose to take advantage of the fact that even inexpensive ePub reading devices like the Kobo Clara have grayscale available, while smartphones and tablets have full color available. The result is much better.</p>
      <p>I also chose not to include the range of <span class="taxon">Dipodomys heermanni</span> into Oregon. At the time, that was acurate, but the subspecies of <span class="taxon">Dipodomys heermanni</span> that ranges that far north has since been elevated to full species status based upon very compelling genetics.</p>
      <p>By leaving out the Oregon portion of the range on that map, the height of the figure is reduced making it less likely that the caption accompanying the figure will float to a second page on devices with less vertical height relative to horizontal width.</p>
      <p>I plan on recreating Figure 1 with a more accurate but less detailed coast, probably modeled off the maps in <a href="litcited.xhtml#grinnell-1922">Grinnell 1922</a>, my next major project for Pipfrosch Press. I also plan to use cubic Bézier curves for the coast, rivers, and lakes, and place them with better geographical accuracy.</p>

  <section id="plates" aria-labelledby="platesh2">
    <h2 id="platesh2">Plates</h2>
    <p>The canonical journal article uses two photographic plates. The first has eight images arranged in a 2&#215;4 grid and the second has ten images arranged in a 2&#215;5 grid. Those layouts do not work well with flowabla ePub content.</p>
    <p>For the first plate, it is my opinion that seven of the eight images are adequately described by the associated caption, with the eighth plate <em>mostly</em> adequately described by the associated caption.</p>
    <p>For the second plate, only one of the ten images is adequately described by the associated caption. The other nine are useless to those who can not see them without adequate detailed descriptions of the images themselves.</p>
    <p>Ten photographic images in total that need alternative text provided for the document to be accessible. The JSTOR <abbr>PDF</abbr> does not provide alternative text for any of them.</p>
    <p>This is a prime blatant example of where automated accessibility test software fails. If you upload the JSTOR <abbr>PDF</abbr> to an automated accessibility test site, it will claim it is <abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2.0 AA compliant, with statistics showing 34 images that have alternative text.</p>
    <p>Even if you include the four figures, the paper would only have 22 images. So how the frack do they have 34 images with alternative text? Simple. A scanned page counts as an image, and the <abbr>OCR</abbr> text for those scanned pages counts as alternative text.</p>
    <p>The <em>actual</em> images do not have alternative text. The scanned page they are part of has <abbr>OCR</abbr> from the journal page they appear on.</p>
    <p>Automated accessibility tests help identify blatant accessibility errors, but they say nothing about actual compliance.</p>
    <p>This ePub has proper alternative text for all ten images that benefit from alternative text, and the other eight images have the apprioate <code>aria-labelledby</code> set to identify the caption specific to the image as suitable alternative text.</p>

  <section id="biblio" aria-labelledby="biblioh2">
    <h2 id="biblioh2">Works Cited Accessibility</h2>
    <p>As is common in academic articles, the canonical journal article as a bibliography that is full of acronyms.</p>
    <p>With respect to journal names, many of these abbreviations are actually standardized. However if you have ever listened to an academic bibliography read by a screen reader, it is an absolutely <em>horrible</em> experience.</p>
    <p>I expanded the vast majority of the abbreviations in the Literature Cited so that this issue can be avoided.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, I hunted down <abbr>DOI</abbr> and Handle <abbr>URI</abbr> identifiers, and when I could not locate those for the Literature Cited, I huted normal hyperlinks to a source for the article or book being cited.</p>
    <p>Both of those steps make the Literature Cited as it appears in this ePub <em>much</em> more user friendly and accessible than in the JSTOR <abbr>PDF</abbr>.</p>
    <p>Additionally I fixed a couple typos within the bibliography.</p>
    <p>In one instance, the canonical journal articles uses ‘New Mexico’ where the <em>actual</em> journal article actually referred to ‘Mexico’ (<a href="litcited.xhtml#allen-1895">Allen 1895</a>) and in other case the canonical journal article references ‘Volume 9’ where the <em>actual</em> journal article appeared in ‘Volume 11’ (<a href="litcited.xhtml#svihla-1930">Svihla 1930</a>).</p>
    <p>I also added author first names in place of just a first initial when the original article specified it (or alternatively the middle name in place of middle initial in a few cases), <abbr>etc.</abbr></p>
  </section>
  <section id="misc" aria-labelledby="semantich2">
    <h2 id="semantich2">Semantic Markup and Labels</h2>
    <p>In addition to the above changes, I added semantic markup throughout the article where necessary.</p>
    <p>For example, I put the <abbr>HTML</abbr> <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tag around any date or time. This kind of semantic markup can help assistive technology understand how to present the data to the user. Just an example, should the numeric string ‘one-nine-eight-four’ be read as ‘nineteen eighty-four’ or as ‘one-thousand nine-hundrend eighty-four’? Semantic markup can aid in helping assistive technology make that decision.</p>
    <p>Another example, in several places the author describes a list of things inside a paragraph. For the sighted user, it is easy for use to move our eyes through such a list but it is not as easy for a blind user unless there is markup designating that the various strings within the paragraph are items in a list. I tried to add that kind of contextual markup where I recognized a need for it.</p>
    <p>The canonical journal article marks major sections with centered bold text. I <em>suspect</em> the JSTOR <abbr>OCR</abbr> technology properly flagged those as heading level regions in the <abbr>PDF</abbr>, but within those major sections, the canonical journal article maks subsections by using italicized text followed by a period and then an em-dash. My guess is the <abbr>OCR</abbr> technology missed marking those as markers. They are appropriately labeled in this ePub.</p>

  <section id="extendable" aria-labelledby="extendableh2">
    <h2 id="extendableh2">Extendable Accessibility</h2>
    <p>In several nations, including the United States, institutions like libraries and universities are specifically given authority under law to modify a work for the purpose of adding accessibility features needed by a user.</p>
    <p><abbr>PDF</abbr> is very difficult to modify. Even things like changing the font to a font that a certain user needs to lower accessibility barriers is virtually impossible with <abbr>PDF</abbr>.</p>

  <section id="missing" aria-labelledby="missingh2">
    <h2 id="missingh2">Missing Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Note that I believe this to be beyond the scope of <abbr>JSTOR</abbr>.</p>
    <p>Pipfrosch Press tagets an audience of citizen science rather than audience of academic science.</p>
    <p>As such, for Pipfrosch Press publications to be accessible, there needs to be a glossary of terms that someone with a ninth grade level of education may not understand.</p>
    <p>I am in the process of identifying which terms need a glossary entry. Once those terms have been identified, then I will need to create a glossary for those terms, hopefully Pipfrosch Press will be able to reach an agreement with a publisher that already published definitions of scientific terms that allows us to use their definitions when needed as such definitions have likely already been professionally reveiwed.</p>

  <section id="jstor" aria-labelledby="jstorh2">
    <h2 id="jstorh2">The Importance of JSTOR</h2>
    <p>It needs to be made abundantly clear that Pipfrosch Press believed JSTOR performs a critical role in academic research.</p>
    <p>Journal articles <em>must</em> be digitally preserved as published, including original pagination, and <em>must</em> be made available to researchers in that form. JSTOR meets that need.</p>
    <p>I do believe JSTOR has a responsibility to improve the accessibility of their archived <abbr>PDF</abbr> documents, to the technical extent that <abbr>PDF</abbr> allows for, but I do not think ill of JSTOR and I do believe they provide a very important service that benefits society.</p>
    <section title="swartz" aria-labelledby="swartzh3">
      <h3 id="swartzh3">Aaron Swartz</h3>
      <p>As a fan of Aaron Swartz, many are surprised that I do no begrudge JSTOR.</p>
      <p>When you live in poverty, as I do, systematic oppression of the poor class by the upper class is very apparant.</p>
      <p>The $20 a month it costs for <a href="https://support.jstor.org/hc/en-us/articles/115004675707-JPASS-Individual-Subscriptions-to-JSTOR" title="Internet Link">JPASS</a> is a financial barrier to access for many of us, myself included. For those who live in financial privilege, $20 a month being a barrier may seem like a foreign concept, but when you have to ration rice and pasta just so you can afford to pay your phone bill, $20 a month is a very real barrier to access.</p>
      <p>Libraries have access to many of these materials for free, but believe it or not, it is actually much easier to visit a library and take advantage of those free resources when you have financial privilege than when you are poor.</p>
      <p>Aaron Swartz understood this. He thought it was ridiculous that access to academic research should be restricted by socio-economic class in an age when the Internet significantly lowers the cost of disseminating such information.</p>
      <p>If you have not done so, please read his <a href="https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt" target="Internet Resource">Guerilla Open Access Manifesto</a>.</p>
      <p>When he tried to do something about it, it led to his death. What he did was illegal. I will not say it was wrong, I do not believe what he did was wrong, but what he did was <em>technically</em> illegal.</p>
      <p>The United States government ruthelessly prosecuted him for it, and I do mean ruthlessly. What the federal prosecutors did was immoral and wrong. What the federal prosecutors did may have been legal, but it was without a doubt immoral and wrong.</p>
      <p>JSTOR had no desire to prosecute him, let me make that very clear. It was the oligarchy that does not want the class division to disappear that ruthlessly wanted him prosecuted and contributed to his death.</p>
      <p>If you do not believe their is an oligarchy in the United States, the same government that says we can not afford to provide health care to the poor&#8212;resulting in numerous deaths because meducines like insulin that costs a mere $5.00 per vial to make is sold for several hundred dollars&#8212;was more than willing to pump <strong>trillions</strong> (yes, multiple trillions) into the stock market during the 2020 to save their own assets. What do you call that if not an oligarchy?</p>
      <p>I do not like the JSTOR financial barrier and I want that to go away, but JSTOR did not want to prosecute Aaron Swarz. To place blame on them for his prosecution is misplaced blame. The blame squarely belongs with the United States of America, as the title of the case&#8212;<span class="italic">United States of America <abbr>v.</abbr> Aaron Swartz</span>&#8212;clearly indicates.</p>
      <p>Place the blame where it <em>clearly</em> belongs, with the government of the United States of America.</p>
      <p>True patriots want to fix the problems with their country, they do not turn a blind eye to the problems.</p>

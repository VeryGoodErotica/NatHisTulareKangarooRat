  <p>Both areas studied were heavily grazed by sheep. Forage was sparse, parallel sheep
trails a few feet apart lined the hillsides, and preventable erosion had set in at many
places. Although the foraging activity of <span class="taxon">tularensis</span> often noticeably depleted the vegetation
along the surface runs and in small areas about the entrances to the burrows, it
appeared that in the areas studied the grazing of sheep and their trampling out of plants
was the major factor in holding the areas to their present low carrying capacity for livestock.</p>
